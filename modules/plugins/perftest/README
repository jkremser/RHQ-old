Usage
=============================

- Deploy the perftest plugin to the JON server (by default, the agent will download the plugin on startup)
- The scenario to use is specified to the agent through a system property. The value of this property should be the
  name of the XML file without the .xml extension. The property name is on.perftest.scenario. For example (remove
  the quotes)

    "-Don.perftest.scenario=high-servers-1000"

- Some scenarios may be configurable and require other system properties to dictate its behavior. Check the
  scenario itself for more details.
