Usage
=============================

- Deploy the perftest plugin to the RHQ Server (by default, the Agent will download the plugin on startup)
- The scenario to use is specified to the agent through a system property. The value of this property should be the
  name of the XML file without the .xml extension. The property name is rhq.perftest.scenario. For example (remove
  the quotes):

    "-Drhq.perftest.scenario=high-servers-1000"

- Some scenarios may be configurable and require other system properties to dictate their behavior. Check the
  scenario XML files for more details.
