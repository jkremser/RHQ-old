     <method>org.jboss.managed.api.ManagedComponent getManagedComponent()</method>
     <justification>
         This difference is due to fixes applied for bug 835113. The old method signature cannot be added back because it would re-introduce the problem fixed by bug 835113. 
         This method is just protected so it is not visible (or available for use) outside of inheriting classes. 
         Also, this method is just an override for a base method from ManagedComponentComponent. The base class, ManagedComponentComponent, still has both methods available for use. 
         The fix for bug 835113 had the Ejb2BeanComponent override a different base method. 
         
         Based on this, no action to be taken for this difference.
