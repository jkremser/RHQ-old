/**
 * This deploys a bundle of files within a zip archive to a managed directory.
 * 
 * This follows rpm-like rules when updating a deployment and files already exist
 * in previous deployments that need to be re-installed in an updated deployment.
 * The rules are as follows, where the first three columns represent a file's
 * hashcode:
 * <table>
 * <tr><th>ORIGINAL</th><th>CURRENT</th><th>NEW</th><th>What To Do...</th></tr>
 * <tr><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>New file is installed over current*</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>Y</td><td>New file is installed over current</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>X</td><td>Y</td><td>X</td><td>Current file is left as-is</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>X</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>New file is installed over current*</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>X</td><td>Y</td><td>Z</td><td>New file is installed over current, current is backed up</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>none</td><td>?</td><td>?</td><td>New file is installed over current, current is backed up</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>X</td><td>none</td><td>?</td><td>New file is installed</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>?</td><td>?</td><td>none</td><td>Current file is backed up and deleted</td></tr>
 * </table>
 * (*) denotes that the current file could have been left as-is. If, in the future, we can
 * provide Java with a way to change file permissions or ownership, we would want to
 * copy the new file over the current file and perform the chown/chmod.
 * 
 * Here you can see that there is only one non-trivial case where the new file is <b>not</b> installed, and that
 * is when the original file and the new file have the same hashcode (i.e. was not changed) but
 * the current version of that file was changed (in the trivial case, where there is no new file, nothing is
 * installed and the current file is uninstalled). In this case, since the original file and the new
 * file are identical, the file with the modifications made to the original version (called the "current" version)
 * is presumed to still be valid for the new version, thus we leave the current, modified file in place.
 * 
 * In the case where there is ambiguity as to what the right thing to do is, the current file is
 * backed up prior to being overwritten with the new file. This can occur in two cases: the first
 * is when the current file is a modified version of the original and the new file is different
 * from the original; the second is when there was no original file, but there is now a current
 * file on disk and a new file to be installed. In either case, the current file is backed up
 * before the new file is copied over top the current file. Files that need to be
 * backed up will have its backup copied to new deployment's metadata directory, under
 * the backup subdirectory called {@link DeploymentsMetadata#BACKUP_DIR}. If a file
 * that needs to be backed up is referred to via an absolute path (that is, outside the destination
 * directory), it will be copied to the {@link DeploymentsMetadata#EXT_BACKUP_DIR} directory found
 * in the metadata directory.
