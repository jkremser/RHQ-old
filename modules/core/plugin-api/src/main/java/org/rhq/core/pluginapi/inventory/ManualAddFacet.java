/**
 * This allows a discovery component to support Resources being manually added. A manual add is initiated when a GUI user
 * goes to the Child Resources section of the Resource's Inventory>Overview tab and chooses to manually add a new child
 * Resource. The user then specifies the connection properties (i.e. plugin configuration) that should be used to
 * to connect to the Resource. A request is then sent to the Plugin Container, which calls the {@link #discoverResource}
 * method on the discovery component. The option to manually add a Resource is only exposed by the GUI for Resource
 * types defined with supportsManualAdd="true" in the plugin descriptor. Manual add is used either to add an offline
 * managed resource to inventory or to add a managed resource that could not be auto-discovered for some reason.
 *
 * <i>Note:</i> this facet is to be implemented by {@link ResourceDiscoveryComponent} instances, unlike most other
 * facets that are implemented by the resource instance components.
 *
 * @param <T> the parent resource component type for those resources discovered by this discovery component
